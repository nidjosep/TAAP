# Describes where data came from

The data is populated in the application while it runs. The data can come from the Professor who creates lab session, the Teaching Assistant who can evaluate and grade a students work and the Student who can fill his details for contacting the Teaching Assistant.
Therefore in summary the data is generated dynamically as the application runs and is put into its use case.
